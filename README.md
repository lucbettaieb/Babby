###Babby
A bunch of code to make Babby alive

---

Babby comes alive with code!  Babby is a robot that was originally built at MHacks II.  While it didn't get much movement except for some kicking, its currently under development!

Babby is and will be a simple version of the NASA ATHLETE rover platform.  Check out more info and some pics here: https://seelio.com/w/b0o/babby
