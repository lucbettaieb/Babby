###Babby
A bunch of code to make Babby alive

---

Babby comes alive with code!  Babby is a robot that was originally built at MHacks II.  While it didn't get much movement except for some kicking, its currently under development!

Babby is and will be a simple version of the NASA ATHLETE rover platform.  Check out more info and some pics here: https://seelio.com/w/b0o/babby


###What is a Babby?


A Babby is a small robot which moves in a manner similar to that of NASA's ATHLETE. Right now, a Babby (hopefully) works by building a terrain map from an range finder module and moving its legs via servo motors to correct for slopes etc.

###How is babby formed?

Right now, our babby is constructed with the following:

 - A Raspberry Pi (Model B)
 - An Arduino board (DeLuminave)
 - 4 DC Motors
 - 4 Servo Motors
 - A LASER-cut wooden frame
 - An ultrasonic range finder

###What is the status of the project?

The current status of our babby project is:
  In progress; not yet functional
